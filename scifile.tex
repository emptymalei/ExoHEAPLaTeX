  Exoplanets is gaining more and more attentions since more and more exoplanets are discovered. Questions are arising from exoplanets and many of them has to be related to high energy astrophysics, such as high energy photon production, absorption, and scattering, accretion process, destruction of massive astrophysical objects. This term paper is a review of high energy astrophysics related to exoplanets.

\section*{Introduction}

This section is an introduction of exoplanets and the detection of them, and high energy astrophysics phenomena.

Exoplanet, a.k.a. extrasolar planet, is a planet orbiting a star other than our sun, stellar remnant or dwarfs star. The first exoplanet orbiting a main sequence star was detected in 1995, which was named as 51 Pegasi b, while th first exoplanet discovered is a planet around a pulsar and was discovered in 1992.

The most obvious characteristics of exoplanets is the variety. Our detection method has a very clear bias over the kind of planets we can discover. Even with technologies like that, exoplanets show many different properties.

\caption{Exoplanets show a lot of varieties even for their dynamical parameters. These parameters spans a wide range.}
\label{fig:variety-exo}
\end{figure}

However, at the same time, they also obey some statistical laws, which makes it more interesting to dig deep in to the properties of explanets.

\label{fig:benfordslaw}
\end{figure}


Since this is a high energy astrophysics term paper, our focus is on the relation to high energy astrophysics phenomena, which is the detection of exoplanets by observing high energy photons and the effect of high energy photons on exoplanets.




\section*{Exoplanet}

In the history of civilization of human, planets has been one of most important keys to our understanding of mother nature. Earth, the most important planet to us, is the only planets we now know of has intelligent life. However, the questions

\begin{quote}
Where Do We Come From? What Are We? Where Are We Going?
\end{quote}

has always been inside the mind of everyone. These questions are more or less related to

\begin{quote}
Where does the seed of life come from? Are we alone in the universe? Are there habitable planets or moons in the universe?
\end{quote}

While at this stage, the science behind them is the research of exoplanets, of which the most important part is the detection and characterization.



\subsection*{Detection of Exoplanets}

The most popular detection methods are transit and radial velocity, while other methods like direct imaging, microlensing and astrometry etc are less used.

\subsubsection*{Transit}

Transit is used by Kepler satellite, on which the satellite detect the period changing of light curve of stars. A planet moving to the line of sight the star could dimmer the star light coming to us. One good aspect about this eclipse method is that we can also collect the spectrum of planet atmosphere thus inferring the composition of it.

The detection take the advantage of two events, transition and occulation. The question is that in what situation we could detect such an event.


\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{./assets/transit}
\caption{The idea of transit. Image taken from \cite{2010arXiv1001.2010W}.}
\label{fig:transit}
\end{figure}

Planets orbiting stars on Keplerian orbit, which is described by elliptical function. However observed by the observer, the orbit is in three dimensions, requiring two extra parameters to describe the orbital motion, inclination and ascending node. 

The shadow band \cite{2010arXiv1001.2010W} is the penumbra casted by the planet. To describe this band it requires a frame where the star is stationary and the penumbra of the moving planet draws the shadow band. If the observor can fall inside the umbra of the planet, the transit signal would be stronger.

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{./assets/shadowband}
\caption{Shadow band of the system. Image taken from \cite{2010arXiv1001.2010W}.}
\label{fig:shadowband}
\end{figure}

Assuming the inclination angle is uniformly distributed, the shadow band fraction gives us the probability of observed transit by a fixed observer.\cite{2010arXiv1001.2010W}

\begin{equation}
P_{tra} = \left( \frac{R_* + R_p }{a} \right) \left( \frac{1 + e \sin \omega}{1 - e^2} \right) ,
\end{equation}

in which $e$ is the eccentricity, $R_*$ is the radius of the star, $R_p$ is the radius of the planet, $a$ is the semimajor axis, $\omega$ is the angle between periapse and ascending node.

The shadow band of antumbra can also be calculated using 

\begin{equation}
P_{tra,antumbra} = \left( \frac{R_* - R_p }{a} \right) \left( \frac{1 + e \sin \omega}{1 - e^2} \right) .
\end{equation}

In the observation, transition duration can be used to reconstruct the system. The edge of the planetary disk contacts the stellar disk four times, the first time is when the two disks touch each other, as the planetary disk moves inside the stellar disk, another tangent happens, then the two inverse process happen when the planetary disk moves out of the stellar disk. The four contacts are denoted as $t_1$, $t_2$, $t_3$ and $t_4$ respectively. An example of transit is shown in figure \ref{fig:wasp43btransit}.

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{./assets/wasp43btransit}
\caption{An example of transit. The black dots are the transit data of WASP-43b while the red line is the best fit using MCMC.\cite{2014A&A...563A..41M}}
\label{fig:wasp43btransit}
\end{figure}

The flux of the system starts to drop at time $t_1$ and restores at time $t_4$. The duration is the difference of the two points,

\begin{equation}
T_t=t_4 - t_1 .
\end{equation}


However, there are features in the transit. The flux doesn't drop immediately but drops with some different stages. Thus the other three time scales are defined.

\begin{equation}
\begin{align}
T_f &= t_3 - t_2, \qquad &\text{full duration} \\
T_i &= t_2-t_1, \qquad &\text{ingress duration} \\
T_e &= t_4 - t_3, \qquad &\text{egress duration} .
\end{align}
\end{equation}








\subsubsection*{Radial Velocity}

Radial velocity helped us to identify the first exoplanet. The method take advantage of the spectrum shift of the host star due to the movement of it. The amplitude of the velocity $k$ determines the shift of the spectrum.

The description of a orbital motion requires five parameters, period $P$, mass of the planet $M_p$, mass of the host star $M_*$, inclination of the orbit $i$, eccentricity of the orbit $e$. Applying these parameters, the amplitude of the radial velocity is calculated as

\begin{equation}
\frac{P K^3(1-e^2)^{3/2}}{2\pi G} = \frac{M_p^3\sin^3 i}{(M_p+M_*)^2},
\end{equation}

where $G$ is Newton's constant. The right hand side of the equation is defined as mass function of the system.\cite{2013pss3.book..489W}

Period $P$ and amplitude $K$ is what we observe from spectrum, while stellar mass is usually calculated from stellar models. Using these the lower limit of planet mass is determined, which is actually $M_p\sin i$.


\section*{High Energy Astrophysics}













\section*{Introduction}

In this file, we present some tips and sample mark-up to assure your
\LaTeX\ file of the smoothest possible journey from review manuscript
to published {\it Science\/} paper.  We focus here particularly on
issues related to style files, citation, and math, tables, and
figures, as those tend to be the biggest sticking points.  Please use
the source file for this document, \texttt{scifile.tex}, as a template
for your manuscript, cutting and pasting your content into the file at
the appropriate places.

{\it Science\/}'s publication workflow relies on Microsoft Word97.  To
translate \LaTeX\ files into Word97, we use an intermediate MS-DOS
routine \cite{tth} that converts the \TeX\ source into HTML\@.  The
routine is generally robust, but it works best if the source document
is clean \LaTeX\ without a significant freight of local macros or
\texttt{.sty} files.  Use of the source file \texttt{scifile.tex} as a
template, and calling {\it only\/} the \texttt{.sty} and \texttt{.bst}
files specifically mentioned here, will generate a manuscript that
should be eminently reviewable, and yet will allow your paper to
proceed quickly into our production flow upon acceptance \cite{use2e}.


\section*{Formatting Citations}

Citations can be handled in one of three ways.  The most
straightforward (albeit labor-intensive) would be to hardwire your
citations into your \LaTeX\ source, as you would if you were using an
ordinary word processor.  Thus, your code might look something like
this:


\begin{quote}
\begin{verbatim}
However, this record of the solar nebula may have been
partly erased by the complex history of the meteorite
parent bodies, which includes collision-induced shock,
thermal metamorphism, and aqueous alteration
({\it 1, 2, 5--7\/}).
\end{verbatim}
\end{quote}


\noindent Compiled, the last two lines of the code above, of course, would give notecalls in {\it Science\/} style:

\begin{quote}
\ldots thermal metamorphism, and aqueous alteration ({\it 1, 2, 5--7\/}).
\end{quote}

Under the same logic, the author could set up his or her reference list as a simple enumeration,

\begin{quote}
\begin{verbatim}
{\bf References and Notes}

\bibitem[Winn(2010)]{2010arXiv1001.2010W} Winn, J.~N.\ 2010, 
arXiv:1001.2010 

\begin{enumerate}
\item G. Gamow, {\it The Constitution of Atomic Nuclei
and Radioactivity\/} (Oxford Univ. Press, New York, 1931).
\item W. Heisenberg and W. Pauli, {\it Zeitschr.\ f.\ 
Physik\/} {\bf 56}, 1 (1929).
\end{enumerate}
\end{verbatim}
\end{quote}

\noindent yielding

\begin{quote}
{\bf References and Notes}

\begin{enumerate}
\item G. Gamow, {\it The Constitution of Atomic Nuclei and
Radioactivity\/} (Oxford Univ. Press, New York, 1931).
\item W. Heisenberg and W. Pauli, {\it Zeitschr.\ f.\ Physik} {\bf 56},
1 (1929).
\end{enumerate}
\end{quote}

That's not a solution that's likely to appeal to everyone, however ---
especially not to users of B{\small{IB}}\TeX\ \cite{inclme}.  If you
are a B{\small{IB}}\TeX\ user, we suggest that you use the
\texttt{Science.bst} bibliography style file and the
\texttt{scicite.sty} package, both of which we are downloadable from our author help site
(http://www.sciencemag.org/about/authors/prep/TeX_help/).  You can also
generate your reference lists by using the list environment
\texttt{\{thebibliography\}} at the end of your source document; here
again, you may find the \texttt{scicite.sty} file useful.

Whether you use B{\small{IB}}\TeX\ or \texttt{\{thebibliography\}}, be
very careful about how you set up your in-text reference calls and
notecalls.  In particular, observe the following requirements:

\begin{enumerate}
\item Please follow the style for references outlined at our author
  help site and embodied in recent issues of {\it Science}.  Each
  citation number should refer to a single reference; please do not
  concatenate several references under a single number.
\item Please cite your references and notes in text {\it only\/} using
  the standard \LaTeX\ \verb+\cite+ command, not another command
  driven by outside macros.
\item Please separate multiple citations within a single \verb+\cite+
  command using commas only; there should be {\it no space\/}
  between reference keynames.  That is, if you are citing two
  papers whose bibliography keys are \texttt{keyname1} and
  \texttt{keyname2}, the in-text cite should read
  \verb+\cite{keyname1,keyname2}+, {\it not\/}
  \verb+\cite{keyname1, keyname2}+.
\end{enumerate}

\noindent Failure to follow these guidelines could lead
to the omission of the references in an accepted paper when the source
file is translated to Word97 via HTML.

\section*{Handling Math, Tables, and Figures}

Following are a few things to keep in mind in coding equations,
tables, and figures for submission to {\it Science}.

\paragraph*{In-line math.}  The utility that we use for converting
from \LaTeX\ to HTML handles in-line math relatively well.  It is best
to avoid using built-up fractions in in-line equations, and going for
the more boring ``slash'' presentation whenever possible --- that is,
for \verb+$a/b$+ (which comes out as $a/b$) rather than
\verb+$\frac{a}{b}$+ (which compiles as $\frac{a}{b}$).  Likewise,
HTML isn't tooled to handle certain overaccented special characters
in-line; for $\hat{\alpha}$ (coded \verb+$\hat{\alpha}$+), for
example, the HTML translation code will return [\^{}$(\alpha)$].
Don't drive yourself crazy --- but if it's possible to avoid such
constructs, please do so.  Please do not code arrays or matrices as
in-line math; display them instead.  And please keep your coding as
\TeX-y as possible --- avoid using specialized math macro packages
like \texttt{amstex.sty}.

\paragraph*{Displayed math.} Our HTML converter sets up \TeX\
displayed equations using nested HTML tables.  That works well for an
HTML presentation, but Word97 chokes when it comes across a nested
table in an HTML file.  We surmount that problem by simply cutting the
displayed equations out of the HTML before it's imported into Word97,
and then replacing them in the Word document using either images or
equations generated by a Word equation editor.  Strictly speaking,
this procedure doesn't bear on how you should prepare your manuscript
--- although, for reasons best consigned to a note \cite{nattex}, we'd
prefer that you use native \TeX\ commands within displayed-math
environments, rather than \LaTeX\ sub-environments.

\paragraph*{Tables.}  The HTML converter that we use seems to handle
reasonably well simple tables generated using the \LaTeX\
\texttt{\{tabular\}} environment.  For very complicated tables, you
may want to consider generating them in a word processing program and
including them as a separate file.

\paragraph*{Figures.}  Figure callouts within the text should not be
in the form of \LaTeX\ references, but should simply be typed in ---
that is, \verb+(Fig. 1)+ rather than \verb+\ref{fig1}+.  For the
figures themselves, treatment can differ depending on whether the
manuscript is an initial submission or a final revision for acceptance
and publication.  For an initial submission and review copy, you can
use the \LaTeX\ \verb+{figure}+ environment and the
\verb+\includegraphics+ command to include your PostScript figures at
the end of the compiled PostScript file.  For the final revision,
however, the \verb+{figure}+ environment should {\it not\/} be used;
instead, the figure captions themselves should be typed in as regular
text at the end of the source file (an example is included here), and
the figures should be uploaded separately according to the Art
Department's instructions.


\section*{What to Send In}

What you should send to {\it Science\/} will depend on the stage your manuscript is in:

\begin{itemize}
\item {\bf Important:} If you're sending in the initial submission of
  your manuscript (that is, the copy for evaluation and peer review),
  please send in {\it only\/} a PostScript or PDF version of the
  compiled file (including figures).  Please do not send in the \TeX\ 
  source, \texttt{.sty}, \texttt{.bbl}, or other associated files with
  your initial submission.  (For more information, please see the
  instructions at our Web submission site,
  http://www.submit2science.org/ .)
\item When the time comes for you to send in your revised final
  manuscript (i.e., after peer review), we require that you include
  all source files and generated files in your upload.  Thus, if the
  name of your main source document is \texttt{ltxfile.tex}, you
  need to include:
\begin{itemize}
\item \texttt{ltxfile.tex}.
\item \texttt{ltxfile.aux}, the auxilliary file generated by the
  compilation.
\item A PostScript file (compiled using \texttt{dvips} or some other
  driver) of the \texttt{.dvi} file generated from
  \texttt{ltxfile.tex}, or a PDF file distilled from that
  PostScript.  You do not need to include the actual \texttt{.dvi}
  file in your upload.
\item From B{\small{IB}}\TeX\ users, your bibliography (\texttt{.bib})
  file, {\it and\/} the generated file \texttt{ltxfile.bbl} created
  when you run B{\small{IB}}\TeX.
\item Any additional \texttt{.sty} and \texttt{.bst} files called by
  the source code (though, for reasons noted earlier, we {\it
    strongly\/} discourage the use of such files beyond those
  mentioned in this document).
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

% Your references go at the end of the main text, and before the
% figures.  For this document we've used BibTeX, the .bib file
% scibib.bib, and the .bst file Science.bst.  The package scicite.sty
% was included to format the reference numbers according to *Science*
% style.
