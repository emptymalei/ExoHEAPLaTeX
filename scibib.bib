@misc{use2e, note = "As the mark-up of the \TeX\ source for this

@misc{inclme, note="Among whom are the author of this document.  The
``real'' references and notes contained herein were compiled using
B{\small{IB}}\TeX\ from the sample .bib file \texttt{scibib.bib}, the style

\texttt{Science.bst}."}


@misc{nattex, note="One of the equation editors we use, Equation Magic
(MicroPress Inc., Forest Hills, NY; http://www.micropress-inc.com/),
interprets native \TeX\ source code and generates an equation as an
OLE picture object that can then be cut and pasted directly into Word.
This editor, however, does not handle \LaTeX\ environments (such as
\texttt{\{array\}} or \texttt{\{eqnarray\}}); it can interpret only
\TeX\ codes.  Thus, when there's a choice, we ask that you avoid these
\LaTeX\ calls in displayed math --- for example, that you use the
\TeX\ \verb+\matrix+ command for ordinary matrices, rather than the
\LaTeX\ \texttt{\{array\}} environment."}
